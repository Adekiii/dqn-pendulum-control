# Complex Adaptive Systems final project
This repository contains the code for the final project of my course Complex Adaptive Systems, where I implement the Deep Q-learning algorithm for the pendulum swing-up task.
With a replay buffer and an epsilon-greedy exploration policy, the aim is for the agent to learn to control the pendulum to stay upright.
